## 🧠 About Me

I'm an AI researcher and data scientist passionate about advancing **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Data Science** for impactful, real-world applications. With a Ph.D. in Computer Science from McGill University, I’ve led and contributed to open-source tools and publications at the intersection of deep learning, NLP, and cybersecurity.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🤖 AI & LLMs

- 🧩 [**Miles_AI_Collection**](https://github.com/MilesQLi/Miles_AI_Collection)  
  A curated repository of my LLM experiments, including training, and application built with LangChain etc.

- 💬 [**Virtual Customer Service Representative (RAG)**](https://github.com/MilesQLi/VirtualCustomerServiceRepresentative)  
  Two-page web app (**Admin** + **Chat**) with a FastAPI backend using **LangChain + LangGraph ReAct agent** and **FAISS vector store** (Ollama embeddings) for retrieval-augmented generation.  
  - Admin panel to configure models and upload knowledge files (PDF/TXT) for indexing.  
  - Chat interface with persistent sessions and retrieval-augmented responses.  
  - Integrates with local OpenAI-compatible LLMs and Ollama embeddings.  

- 🦙 [**DMaS-LLaMa-Lite-Training-Code**](https://github.com/McGill-DMaS/DMaS-LLaMa-Lite-Training-Code)  
  Complete training pipeline for a 1.7B-parameter LLaMa-based model, optimized for data-efficiency.

- 🔁 [**Incremental-LLM-Training**](https://github.com/McGill-DMaS/Incremental-LLM-Training)  
  Layer-wise incremental LLM training: a novel paradigm to improve compute utilization and training throughput.
